BITWISE OPERATORS IN C++

This project demonstrates the usage and implementation of **bitwise operators** in C++. Bitwise operators perform operations on the binary representations of integers.

## Objective
- Understand how different **bitwise operators** work in C++
- Use them in simple programs to manipulate binary data
- See the results of bitwise operations on integer variables

## Bitwise Operators in C++
| Operator | Name              | Description                                  |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `&`      | AND               | Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1        |
| `|`      | OR                | Sets each bit to 1 if one of the bits is 1   |
| `^`      | XOR               | Sets each bit to 1 if only one bit is 1      |
| `~`      | NOT (Oneâ€™s Comp)  | Inverts all the bits                         |
| `<<`     | Left Shift        | Shifts bits to the left                      |
| `>>`     | Right Shift       | Shifts bits to the right                     |
